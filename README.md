Conscious Resonance and Forked Causality (CRFC)
A 420-Law Framework for Timeline Divergence and Cognitive Resonance
This repository houses the Conscious Resonance and Forked Causality (CRFC) theory‚Äîa rigorous, philosophically grounded model exploring how consciousness navigates probabilistic timelines through arbitrary micro-decisions, producing resonant events (e.g., the "1:11 pickup"). Rooted in chaos theory, cognitive science, and symbolic pattern analysis, CRFC defines 420 axiomatic laws to map the interplay of Fork Fields (‚Ñ±), selective perception, and non-narrative causality.
üåå Purpose
CRFC unifies subjective experience with objective causality, offering a framework that withstands scrutiny from physicists, philosophers, and rational mystics. It formalizes "downloads"‚Äîintuitive insights often amplified by THC (via CB1/CB2 receptor synergy)‚Äîas compressions of high-entropy Fork Fields into meaningful patterns.
üìÅ Structure

laws/: 420 .md files, each detailing a law (e.g., law_001_fork_field.md).
theory/: Core axioms, glossary, and metaphysical foundations.
models/: LaTeX equations (e.g., $P(\mathcal{R}) \propto S(C_i, E_j)$) and diagrams.
notes/: Raw insights, thought experiments, and dialogues.

üß† Key Concepts

Fork Field (‚Ñ±): A lattice of possible outcomes from micro-decisions.
Resonance Event (‚Ñõ): Perceived synchronicity when attention aligns with a timeline path.
Symbolic Attractors: Numbers and/or symbols like 1:11 or 4:20 that anchor consciousness due to cultural/neural salience.
Quantum Tunneling: Metaphor for collapsing high-density forks into observed reality.
